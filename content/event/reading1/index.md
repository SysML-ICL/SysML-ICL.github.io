title: "Reading Group Session #1"

location: Huxley 217 - Imperial College London
#address:
#  postcode: 'Room 145'

summary: vPipe (TPDS'21) & Alpa (OSDI'22)
abstract: "We discuss two recent works focused on distributed DL training. vPipe is a virtualized memory manager for pipeline parallel training. Alpa is a runtime capable of autoparallelization of large deep networks."
