summary: Davis Blalock will present his work on MADDNESS (PMLR'21)
abstract: |
  Multiplying matrices is among the most fundamental and compute-intensive operations
  in machine learning. Consequently, there has been significant work on efficiently approximating matrix multiplies.
  We introduce a learning-based algorithm for this task that greatly outperforms existing methods.
  
  Experiments using hundreds of matrices from diverse domains show that it often runs 100x
  faster than exact matrix products and 10x faster than current approximate methods. In the common
  case that one matrix is known ahead of time, our method also has the interesting property that it
  requires zero multiply-adds.
  
  These results suggest that a mixture of hashing, averaging, and byte shuffling—the core
  operations of our method—could be a more promising building block for machine learning than the sparsified,
  factorized, and/or scalar quantized matrix products that have recently been the focus of
  substantial research and hardware investment.
