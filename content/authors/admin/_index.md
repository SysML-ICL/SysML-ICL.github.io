Pedro Silvestre is a PhD student in the [Large-Scale Data & Systems Group](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Dr. Peter Pietzuch](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~prp/). His research at Imperial focuses on the interplay between Dataflow Systems and novel Deep Learning workloads, in particular Deep Reinforcement Learning.
Before Imperial, he was a Research Engineer at the TU Delft's [Web Information Systems Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/) working on [Clonos](https://delftdata.github.io/clonos-web/).
